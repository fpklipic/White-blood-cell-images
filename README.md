This is two dataset of white blood cell (WBC) images used for "White Blood Cell Image Segmentation based on Color Component Combination and Contour Fitting", which can be used to evaluate cell image segmentation methods. 

The whole dataset used in this paper can be divided into two parts. The first part is under rapid staining condition WBC images provided by Jiangxi Te Kang Technology Co., Ltd., which contains 100 WBC images. There are not contain whole red blood cells appear in the rapid staining images due to the hemolytic agent was used to dissolve it. Therefore, rapid staining images are convenient for doctors to observe clearly because there are no whole red blood cells in the images. But, rapid staining condition WBC images are blurry in the edge of cytoplasm images, which caused trouble with exact segmenting. The first part of the whole dataset was regarded as the first group.

Another part of the whole dataset used in this paper is under standard staining condition images using St. Regis dye solution, which was provided by The Peopleâ€™s Hospital Affiliated to Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which contains 50 WBC images. The whole red blood cells exist in standard staining condition images due to the hemolytic agent was not be used, which caused the red blood cells potential to adhere with WBCs. Based on whether red blood cells adhere with white blood cells, we divided staining condition image dataset into two parts, which are second group and third group. There are 30 un-adhered images under standard staining condition and 20 adhered images under standard staining condition images in the second group and third group respectively.
